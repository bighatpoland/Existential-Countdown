(Pro tip: Stare into this image long enough, and it'll stare back. Or just crash your browser. Either way, entropy wins.)

## Welcome to the Abyss
Ah, yes, Existential Countdown—the pinnacle of human achievement in mobile app form. Because why chase dreams when you can watch numbers tick down to your inevitable demise? This isn't some feel-good productivity tool; it's a digital middle finger to your fleeting existence. Built for numerophiles who hate serenity, it quantifies the absurdity of life one pointless metric at a time. No motivation, no self-help BS—just cold, hard math mocking your mortality.

Created by Konstancja in sunny Valencia (where even the oranges are existential crises waiting to happen). Launched in the dystopian year of 2026, because why not?

## Features: Because Who Needs Purpose?
- **Estimated Coffees Left in Your Life**: Calculates how many jittery mornings you have before caffeine tolerance turns you into a zombie. Factors in spills, global shortages, and that one time you'll rage-quit coffee for herbal tea (spoiler: you won't).
- **Bulbs You'll Break Before the Lights Go Out**: Tracks your clumsiness with gyroscope magic. AR mode lets you preview shattering your grandma's heirloom lamp. Bonus: Existential rage multiplier.
- **Remaining Sundays**: Subtracts for ones wasted on existential dread or laundry. Integrates with your calendar to remind you that "brunch" is just a distraction from the void.
- **Steps to the Next Street Lamp**: GPS-enabled nonsense. Vibrates like a doomsday clock as you wander aimlessly. Detours for potholes included—because life loves curveballs.
- **Times You'll Say 'Next Week I'll Start'**: Voice-detects your procrastination lies. Graphs your broken promises in a sad, downward spiral. Pro tip: It never starts next week.
- **Eyelashes You'll Shed Before Balding There Too**: Facial recognition tallies your follicular failures. Alert: "One blink closer to looking like a surprised egg."
- **Breaths Until Your Next Crisis**: Mic-monitored panic predictor. Spikes during traffic or realizing you're just a speck in the cosmos.
- **Forgets Why You Entered a Room**: Motion sensors count your senior moments early. Ding: "Purpose not found. Try again?"
- **Microwave Fork Accidents**: Predicts your next kitchen apocalypse based on midnight munchies. Sparks fly—literally.
- **Raindrops Before Umbrella Betrayal**: Weather API forecasts your soggy fate. Animated icon flips inside out for dramatic effect.
- **Yawns Until Admitting You're Tired of It All**: Camera catches your boredom. "Yawn #4,567: Existence fatigue confirmed."
- **Socks Lost to Dryer Hell**: Simulates eternal mismatches. Karma for all those unpaired victims.
- **Heartbeats to 'I Should Exercise'**: Guilt tracker during binge sessions. Peaks at "one more chip."
- **Ad Scrolls Before Caving In**: Measures your resistance to capitalism. Ends in defeated clicks.
- **Ants Crushed on Walks**: Eco-guilt calculator. Optional: Virtual ant funerals.
- **Phone Battery to Universal Heat Death**: Metaphorical entropy. "42% doomed."
- **'Just One More Episode' Lies**: Sunrise-shaming counter. Dawn is your enemy.
- **Grass Blades Mowed Before Lawn Rebellion**: Questions suburban sanity. AR scans your futile turf war.
- **Wrong Waves at Strangers**: Camera detects awkwardness. Social cringe hall of fame.
- **Dust Inhaled Before Becoming Dust**: Air quality doomsayer. "You are what you breathe—stardust and regret."
- And more! Because life's absurdities are infinite, just like our premium in-app purchases.

## Installation: As Pointless as Everything Else
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/existential-countdown.git` (assuming you have Git. If not, why bother?)
2. Navigate to the void: `cd existential-countdown`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`—watch as your disk space dwindles.
4. Run it: `expo start` (Expo? Yeah, because native development is for masochists.)
5. Scan the QR code with your phone. Drop it? That's one more broken screen in your lifetime counter.

**Requirements:** A soul-crushing device running iOS or Android. Dark mode enforced—light mode users need not apply.

## Usage: Stare Into the Numbers
Launch the app. Input your age and habits (lie if you want; the universe doesn't care). Watch counters decrement in real-time. Get notifications like: "Only 8,942 breaths until panic. Inhale wisely."

Customize: Optimistic mode adds 10% (delusional), Pessimistic subtracts based on world news (realistic), Chaotic randomizes (accurate).

Share your dread: Export memes to friends. "Dread Duels" leaderboard: Who has fewer Sundays? Spoiler: Everyone loses.

## Contributing: Join the Nihilism
Want to add more counters? Like "Times You'll Regret This Contribution"? Fork, PR, and we'll merge if it's absurd enough. Code style? Whatever—entropy will corrupt it anyway.

Issues? File them. We'll fix in "next week's sprint." (See procrastination counter.)

## License: MIT (Mostly Inevitable Termination)
Use it, abuse it, fork it—it's all going to the heat death of the universe anyway. No warranties; if it breaks your spirit, that's a feature.

## Disclaimer: Not responsible for induced existential crises, therapy bills, or sudden urges to quit your job and live in a van. If symptoms persist, consult a philosopher (or uninstall).

Made with 😖 and a healthy dose of sarcasm. Because if we're all doomed, might as well laugh.
